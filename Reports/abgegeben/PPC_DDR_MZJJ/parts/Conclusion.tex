The experiment was divided in three parts. The first two consisted of two different methods to determine the vaporization enthalpy and entropy of Cyclohexane and 1-Propanol. The first method was by measuring the boiling temperature at different pressures. For the second method the transient vaporization cooling was measured with the TREVAC-Apparatus provided by the ETH. Both methods turned out to be accurate, however the second one provided more accurate results which must have been due to the better thermometer which had a way smaller uncertainty. \\

The third part was the verification of Cyclohexane and 1-Propanol by measuring their densities and refraction indices. The density was once measured the naive way by weighing a known volume and once with a very expensive density measuring device. The second method delivered very accurate results, whereas the first was just a bit off the literature values but still good. The refraction indices were also measured by a device which directly gave back the correct values.
